# Simple DnD
## A simple drag and drop made with React.js and Typescript

If you ever had to use react-beatiful-dnd, you know that it is way to complex and annoying. So, I made this simple dnd, that allows you to create a dnd with less than 20 lines of code.

## How to use

All you need to do is to create a component called DndContext and give it its draggables. It will automatically create a few things:

- The necessary divs with the given content
- The container for the draggables
- The container in which the draggables will be put

And that's why you can send the objects with the style for each thing:

- The style for each draggable: draggableStyle
- The style for the container where the draggables will be put: droppableStyle
- The style for the container where the draggables are initially put: initialDraggingSpotStyle
- The style for the container that contains the other two containers: relationStyle

```javascript
const draggables = ['Draggable 1', 'Draggable 2', 'Draggable 3']

function App() {
  return (
    <DndContext 
      draggables={draggables}
      isHorizontal={true}
      draggableStyle={draggableStyle}
      droppableStyle={droppableStyle}
      initialDraggingSpotStyle={initialDraggingSpotStyle}
      relationStyle={relationStyle}
    />
  )
}

export default App
```
